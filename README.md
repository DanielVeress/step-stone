# Step Stone

### by DÃ¡niel Veress

## Overview

This project automatically breaks down large, complex tasks into smaller, clearer steps using an LLM API. This recursive, step-by-step process greatly reduces the user's initial planning time, letting projects start quickly once the main task is defined. The main goal is to deliver a simple, automatic, and flexible task breakdown solution where the initial steps, or any later steps, can be regenerated whenever a new or unexpected problem appears outside the original scope.
